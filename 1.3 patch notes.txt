Important Note!
This version adds Discovery and Unlocking to a majority of Jokers, so this version is best experienced on a new profile, preferably with all base game unlocks (for your sake <3)
The best way to do this would be to Unlock All on a new profile while this mod is NOT enabled, and then load the mod!

Olivia
- Now requires you to reach 10% score to Prevent Death
(previously, she had no limit on how often she could Prevent Death if enough retriggers gave her the required chips, resulting in an infinite build.)
- Now has a custom Saved message!

Jason
Now worded "If AN Ardric is owned" as opposed to "If Ardric is owned" (Keep this in mind!)

Belphegor
Now has a custom Saved message!

Vesta 
- Previous Ability: 
  1.5X on scored wild cards
- New Ability:
  Retriggers wild cards played or held in hand

Advena (Copy)
Now named Viva, as she was given a unique name.
